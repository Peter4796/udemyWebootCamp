    The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus domesticus) is a large and round short-winged bird, domesticated from the red junglefowl
    of Southeast Asia around 8,000 years ago. Most chickens are raised for food, providing meat and eggs; others are
    kept as pets or for cockfighting.
    <p>Chickens are common and widespread domestic animals, with a total population of 26.5 billion as of 2023, and an
        annual production of more than 50 billion birds. A hen bred for laying can produce over 300 eggs per year. There
        are numerous cultural references to chickens in folklore, religion, and literature.</p>
